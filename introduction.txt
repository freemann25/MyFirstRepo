Hi, I’m Achour, a passionate learner in software engineering with a focus on AI application development. My mission is to use technology to solve real community problems, especially in education, infrastructure, and sustainability. I believe growth comes through challenges, and I’ve built a clear plan to overcome mine: strengthening self-confidence, organizing my time with discipline, and continuously learning from failures as stepping stones.
